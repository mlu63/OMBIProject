# OMBIProject

Project done for the Ontario CAO Municipal's Benchmarking Initiative (OMBI)
OMBI's purpose is to collect statistical data about various things over various years to find trends and areas of concern.
In the past, they had displayed this information side-by-side using printouts and graphs in a large book.

We were approached through the University of Western Ontario to attempt to make an application to store the information
on a database and allow users to compare data through a select range of years at a button click, as opposed to print-outs for 
every concerned individual.

This project was made in 2013, and I have since lost some of the files unfortunately. However, much of the functionality still remains
if you're curious to find out how we did it!
